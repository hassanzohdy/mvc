## How Does ORM Work?

## Pros of using an ORM.
* It abstracts away the database system so that switching from MySQL to PostgreSQL, or anything else  is easy.
* most of programs don't like to write SQL all the time , it will help us to avoid writing sql again and again.
* DRY: it saves a lot of time ,you will only write the code once then reuse it
*  Hides and encapsulates change in the data source itself, so that when data sources or their APIs change, only ORM needs to change to keep up
